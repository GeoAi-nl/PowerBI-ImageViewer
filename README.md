# PowerBI-ImageViewer

The image viewer is a simple-to-use Microsoft PowerBI visual for stepping through images by using the navigation arrows.
The user can go fowards and backwards through a dataset creating a single selection in the report. 
Ordering is determined by a user-defined data field and the image is shown based on a web URL. 
The image interacts directly via both filtering and selection on related data within other visuals.

Add this versatile image viewer to your report by following these steps:

-  Download ImageViewerDemo.csv from the repository.
-  Open PowerBi and load the ImageViewerDemo.csv via 'Get data' and 'Text CSV'.
-  Get the latest release https://github.com/GeoAi-nl/PowerBI-ImageViewer/releases/latest.
-  Download the ImageViewer.pbiviz file from the latest release.
-  Open the visualisation panel press 'Get More Visualisations' and then 'Import a visualisation from file'.
-  Select ImageViewer.pbiviz and the new visual is ready for you to use.
-  Add the ImageViewer visual to the report and select it to begin configuring it.
-  Fill the Image_URL and Ordering field and you are ready to step through images.
-  The rest of the report will react to your selected image!
