# PowerBI-ImageViewer

The image viewer is a basic microsoft PowerBI visual for stepping through images. 
By using the arrows on both sides of the window the user can go fowards and backwards through a dataset. 
Ordering is determined by the predefined data field and image is shown based on a weburl. 
The set of images is determined by filtering and selection to show the image.
