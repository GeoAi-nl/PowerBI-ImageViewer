# PowerBI-ImageViewer

The image viewer is a basic Microsoft PowerBI visual for stepping through images by using the arrows on both sides.
The user can go fowards and backwards through a dataset and creating a single selection in the report. 
Ordering is determined by the predefined data field and the image is shown based on a web url. 
The set of images is determined by filtering and selection to show the image.
